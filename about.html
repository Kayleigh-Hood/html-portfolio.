<h1>About Me</h1>
<img src="../assets/images/About_Me.jpeg"height=300 alt="Photo of me">
<p>I am 20 years young and working in Social Media Marketing. I am busy upgrading my skillset and diving into Web Development. I have always had a love for coding and Web Development since High School. I have decided to broaden my perspective and learn a new skill, not only for business purposes, but to challenge and ultimately better myself.
</p>

<p>I live in a small town in South Africa called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kroonstad">Kroonstad</a> and I recently moved in to a charming little house with my boyfriend.</p>


<p>I am currently enrolled in a Udemy course: <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">The Complete 2023 Web Development Bootcamp</a>. Which teaches you the complete set of skills needed for Web Development.
